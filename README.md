# Using Array Methods To Process Data

## Challenges I Faced? 

Some of these JavaScript concepts to me, can be very esoteric nature. Especially when it comes to Manipulating the HTML or data. Also Github seems like a very robust platform And sometimes I have trouble understanding what's happening from tab to tab. And seeing that I only have one day to learn and complete the assignment can make things quite challenging as well.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

By collaborating with my peers I was able to understand and get an overall picture of what I needed to do in order to bring this task to fruition and by doing research on platforms like Google, Github YouTube, MDN docs, Stack Overflow, online courses, and reference guides. I was able to navigate through and complete this assignment.
